# Take Home Assignment (Android Lead)

You should supply the code for review and be ready to reference for the follow-up technical interview and be ready to demo their
code via Screen Share. The purpose of this assignment is to provide us a sample of your code and architecture approach. It
should be representative of what you would do as a professional level. It should be representative of what you would do as a
professional during your day to day on the job. Please take the time to review the grading criteria below.

How will I be graded?
- Solution works.
- Code is clean, well-written, easy to read and contains documentation.
- Functionally works and satisfies the requirements below.
- Clear architecture / Modular architecture is implemented.
- Thoughtful design and user experience is a plus.
- Code is unit tested and with UI/SnapshotTests. Other kinds of tests will be considered pluses.

We incentivize you to perform mindful choices in your software solution and document them in a README, so the evaluators can
follow your train of thought. If you cannot meet all the requirements (due to time constraints or any other reasons), be sure to
inform that as well. If you provide a list of things you would pick to implement next if you were to maintain this project for a longtime, that will be taken as a plus.

Take Home Assignment - Local Sake Shops (Android Native)
For this assignment, you will build a simple app that allows the user to see
1 A screen with a list of local sake shops and
2 A details screen for a specific sake shop.

Requirements:
The data is going to be supplied in JSON format.
The list page should contain items with sake shop names, address, and star ratings.
Whenever a sake shop from the list is tapped, the user should be directed to the details page of that shop. The details page
should contain details about the sake shops, including:
- Shop name.
- Shop picture.
- A brief description.
- A rating in stars.
- Address (clickable, should open address in a Maps app or browser).
- A button or link to visit the shop's website in default web browser or in a custom tab.
  
Instructions:
. Build a list page component that displays all items from the supplied JSON data you got together with this assignment.
. You will be evaluated based on at least some of the following:
a. Modular Architecture Approach powered by Audi RED / CONFIDENTIAL 
b. Clean Architecture
c. Jetpack compose must be used as the native development framework for this assignment.
i. XML views submission will not be accepted.
d. Re-usability of your solution (could someone re-implement your solution easily for a different type of data / different API? ).
e. Good UX and UI will be considered pluses, but you don't need to spend a very long time pixel-perfecting the look and feel
(we don't expect you to be a designer). Follow material design guidelines and you're good.
f. Other factors include: any tests included, ui / snapshot tests, component structure, standards, performance and stability,
etc.

. Feel free to show off your coding ability by adding any level of appropriate complexity.
. Include a README that details information about your project, dependencies, setup, and requirements.
